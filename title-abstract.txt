Title:
Post-Prediction Inference on Political Twitter

Abstract:
Having observed data seems to be a necessary requirement to conduct inference, but what happens when observed outcomes cannot easily be obtained? A growing practice is to simply proceed with using predicted outcomes, but without any corrections this can result in issues like bias and incorrect standard errors. Our project studies a correction method for inference conducted on predicted, not observed outcomes—called post-prediction inference—through the lens of political data. We are investigating the kinds of phrases or words in a tweet will most strongly indicate a person’s political alignment to US politics. We have discovered that these correction techniques are promising in their ability to correct for post-prediction inference in the field of political science.
